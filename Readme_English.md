# nos_gl_CC0
Copyright-free (CC0) sentences in Galician, collected by [Proxecto Nós](nos.gal) in order to contribute to the text corpus of [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/gl/).

The rights to the original sentences were [transferred](https://github.com/proxectonos/nos_gl_CC0/tree/main/CC0_Waiver) to the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC)'s Proxecto Nós by public or private entities, to whom we are grateful for their contribution.

On this material, Proxecto Nos applied a series of transformations which resulted in the corpora herein mentioned. The original sentences were filtered for length and, where necessary, adapted to meet the Common Voice requirements (normalization of numbers, abbreviations, and acronyms, foreign word elimination, appropriateness, grammatical correctness, etc.).

Preprocessing and processing of the corpora was done using dedicated scripts available [here]([...](https://github.com/proxectonos/nos_gl_CC0/tree/main/Scripts), as well as the [Sentence Extractor](https://github.com/common-voice/cv-sentence-extractor) tool. 

The resulting corpora are the following:

166.337 sentences extracted from transcrips of the debates of the [Galician Parliament (Parlamento de Galicia)](https://www.parlamentodegalicia.gal/) over a 7-year timespan (2015-2022). The Galician Parliament allows public access to the original material and authorizes its reproduction provided the source is aknowledged. Apart from the transformations mentioned above, the names present in the corpus were anonymised.
